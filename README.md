## Getting Started

Fork this repository and clone it to your local machine.

Be sure to download the front-end client as well, which can be found [here](https://github.com/labs11-pomodoro-timer/labs11-pomodoroTimer-FE).

### Prerequisites

In order to use this server, you will need to have [node](https://nodejs.org) installed. You can check if node is
installed by typing

```
node -v
```

You will also need to have yarn installed. Installation instructions for yarn can be found [here](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/).

### Installing

First, 

```
yarn install
```

This will install all of the dependencies you need to run the server.

To run the server locally for testing,

```
yarn server
```

NOTE: There are several places in code containing development URIs that begin with "http://localhost...".
Be sure to switch these URIs from production to development and vice versa by commenting out the appropriate
line of URI information.
